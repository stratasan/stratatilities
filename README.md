## Developing

This project uses [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) to maintain proper styling and this is checked in CI. Please setup your editor to format with black automatically.

Their [docs on editor integration](https://github.com/ambv/black#editor-integration) are likely the best way to get up and running with black.

## CI

Continuous integration runs on GitHub Actions. See the `main.workflow` file for how actions are organized.
